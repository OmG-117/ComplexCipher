# ComplexCipher
This is a script that can generate and decrypt ciphers that may or may not be very hard to crack. Actually, the new one is probably pretty hard to crack, but it's mostly still useless.

1. complexciphercore.py: Contains the core cipher generation/decryption functionality for the original ComplexCipher.
2. complexcipherui.py: Contains a local interface for using the script, because I didn't know I don't need a separate file for that.
3. cipherinterpreterbot.py: It's been so long since I last updated this readme that I don't even remember all of what this bot does anymore, but it can do the encoding/decoding stuff and also do suggestions because someone asked for (and never used) it.
4. complexcipher2.py: The new and improved ComplexCipher with more characters (almost all the ASCII printables in fact), cleaner ciphers, actual, real security, and the customary old uselessness because real encryption is still way better.

The other stuff is related to storing data for the bot and deploying it with Heroku, an idea that I have since abandoned because even a Raspberry Pi is fast enough to host the occasional pokes I make at it.
